## Course description

This course is designed to help students learn intermediate to advanced concepts of geographic information science (GIScience) and become proficient users of geographic information systems (GIS).  This course combines fundamental knowledge of GIS and spatial modeling with applications of GIS in solving real-world problems in urban planning, environmental resource management and sustainability. Teaching formats include both lectures, lab exercises, and independent project.

## Objectives & Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students should:
1.	understand the fundamentals of GIS data models, learn to combine spatial analysis into workflows to solve complex modeling tasks;
2.	have sufficient technical skills to apply GIS to solve real-world problems;
3.	be able to successfully organize, manage, and present results from a GIS project;
4.	and, have sufficient knowledge to take electives in the GIS Certificate Program.


## Prerequisites
Introduction to GIS course (GIS 4043C) or GIS 5049 GIS for Non-Majors.  If you do not have the prerequisite, you should drop this course and enroll in GIS 5049.   


## Materials
Student version of the software will be provided for home use. Students completing assignments in the labs will need to have a portable USB drive to save their work.


Optional reference books (use them if you want to learn more than covered in the class):

* *Kanevski, M.F., and M. Maignan. 2004. Analysis and Modelling of Spatial Environmental Data. EPFL Press, Distributed by Marcel Dekker, Inc. ISBN: 0824759818. (focus on Geostatistics)*

### Attendance and Class Participation:
•	**Attendance**: classes (lectures and labs) are delivered synchronously, which require students to virtually attend during the class time. However, when a student cannot attend the class due to a certain reason, students should notify the lecture in advance and provide necessary proofs (such as doctor’s note).
•	**Class discussion**: Students are encouraged to be active during class period. Questions, comments, and critiques are very important to ensure effective learning. Other than staying online, active interactions (answering questions, discussions) in the virtual meetings will be counted in class participation.

## In-Class Quizzes
Quizzes will be assigned during classes through online forms. Students are required to submit answers to the questions during the class. The quiz submission will also be counted in attendance check.

### Lab Exercise
The students will be doing a series of specially designed lab exercises to get familiar with GIS functionality and applications. Also, lab time will be provided for the class to work on individual project. Instructor will be available in MS Teams to assist students. Lab submissions <u>after the due date will NOT be accepted and will receive 0 point</u>. There are 6 labs that account for 50% of the final grade.

The details of project topics, requirements, and deliverables are described in the lecture slides.

### Final Project
Students will use GIS to work on a specific topic for the final project. Students can select from a set of suggested projects, or expand on an existing lab assignment, or develop their own project. The project must be an original piece of work developed in this course and has a certain level of complexity (simply using GIS to create a map may not qualify). Students are encouraged to discuss with the instructor about their project ideas. Project deliverables include:
- **Proposal**: A one- page proposal is due on in Week 8. Students will describe their initial ideas of the final project in the proposal. The instructor will review and give feedback to the proposal.
- **Project Presentation**: Each student will present the final project in a 7-minute presentation plus 3-minute Q & A. Your classmates will evaluate your presentation. Your grade of the presentation is based upon the evaluation of your classmates and the instructor.
- **Project Report**: Students will submit a short report about the final project at the end of the semester.
More details of project topics, requirements, and deliverables will be explained in class.

- Gender-Based Crimes
USF has a commitment to the safety and well-being of our students.  Please be aware that educators must report incidents of sexual harassment and gender-based crimes including sexual assault, stalking, and domestic/relationship violence that come to their attention. I am required to report such incidents in order for the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities or the Office of Diversity, Inclusion, and Equal Opportunity can investigate the incident or situation as a possible violation of the USF Sexual Misconduct/Sexual Harassment Policy and provide assistance to the student making the disclosure. If you disclose in class or to me personally, I must report the disclosure and will assist you in accessing available resources. The Center for Victim Advocacy and Violence Prevention, the Counseling Center and Student Health Services are confidential resources where you can talk about such situations and receive assistance without the incident being reported.
